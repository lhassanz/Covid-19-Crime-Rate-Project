# Covid-19-Crime-Rate-Project
A project I worked on with my group for one of my classes for my Master's Program [Big Data Analytic]. This class is called Big Data Science Analytics.
The code of this project will be under the GEOG_Project folder. The data used for these files are to large to be imported into Github, but can be learned more about from this website: https://sites.google.com/sdsu.edu/bdagroupprojectsite/data-and-methods?authuser=0
